tools to make posting to LindyList.com (1990s era website) easier

## Background
Lindylist.com - a local swing dance event calendar for the SF Bay Area.
It's viewing user interface is great. Utilitarian weekly event listing that is still a popular community resource.
On the other hand, its event creation interface is clunky, antiquated and lacking basic essential features like delete and update existing posts.
The original site developers show no signs of updating the site or letting it die.

## Result
This collection of (commandline and web based) python scripts to make my own event posting tasks easier.

## Done
bands.py - manage a database of bands I frequenty post on the calendar
